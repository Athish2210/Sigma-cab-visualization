# Cab Data Visualization Project

Welcome to the Cab Data Visualization Project! This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing cab-related data to gain insights into various parameters such as trip distance, type of cab, customer ratings, and more. The dataset used for this project includes parameters like Trip_ID, Trip_Distance, Type_of_Cab, Customer_Since_Months, Life_Style_Index, Confidence_Life_Style_Index, Destination_Type, Customer_Rating, and Cancellation_Last_1Month.

## Introduction

Understanding cab-related data is crucial for optimizing services and enhancing customer experiences. This project aims to visualize and analyze various parameters from the cab dataset to derive meaningful insights that can inform decision-making processes.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following parameters:

- Trip_ID
- Trip_Distance
- Type_of_Cab
- Customer_Since_Months
- Life_Style_Index
- Confidence_Life_Style_Index
- Destination_Type
- Customer_Rating
- Cancellation_Last_1Month

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis and visualization)

   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Sigma_cabs_Visualization.ipynb`) to explore and analyze the cab dataset.

2. Execute the notebook cells to load the data, preprocess it, and create visualizations.

## Data Visualization

The notebook contains various data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Visualizations include histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and more to effectively represent the distribution and relationships between different parameters.

## Insights

Derived insights from the data visualizations will be documented in the notebook. This section will provide a summary of key findings, trends, and correlations observed in the dataset.
